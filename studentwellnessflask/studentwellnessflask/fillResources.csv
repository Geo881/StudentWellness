"social"|"How to make friends on campus"|"Many students find it difficult to make friends in general.  Often friendships spring up from being in the same classes throughout high school, or a shared experience such as playing a sport for a number of years with peers.  The university seems massive, but making friends is the same follows the same process.  You have to be willing to do some work and take chances.  We cannot tell you who is going to be trustworthy or who will be there for you when you are at your worst.  Finding those kinds of friends takes time and trusting others in small ways before trusting completely.  Many people find friends through common interests.  Make a list of the things you like to do: activities, hobbies, religion, favorite YouTube videos, etc.  Then when out in common areas, strike up a conversation about what you like and see if you have common interests with others."
"social"|"Connecting to the university"|"We have a vast number of clubs on campus that you can join.  Many clubs meet in the evening, but if needed, ask if you and others can have a satellite meeting during the day - joining the whole group during activities.  Research activities at the university, using lists such as on Today@CCSU.  Find activities that interest you and make an extra effort to attend.  Students hear about how great an activity was two days after the event; you want to be there.  On campus, one of the best places to make friends is in the student center.  Our student center is known as the campus living room and is always active with a variety of events. We encourage students to get involved.  A nice place to start is with a club or CAN (Central Activities Network) where you can meet people with similar interests and plan activities for the campus.  For a full list of clubs, you can visit thelink.ccsu.edu."
"social"|"Who Keeps You Well"|"Who keeps you well activity – In our lives we all have people who keep us well.  These people will react to us in a way that makes us feel better, more positive about being able to get through our troubles in life.  Take a few moments and write down who you think is the best person within your social supports to help you. Take a few moments and write down who you think is the best person within your social supports to help you. Keep this list close to you, such as a note on your smartphone, because we never know when life will throw us a curve."
"social"|"Healthy and Unhealthy Relationships"|"Healthy relationships are HOT - honest, open, and trustworthy.  In these relationships, people are honest with each other.  At any point in time if asked one person about the relationship status, the response would be the same as the other person.  Does not matter if there are 2 or more people in the relationship - everyone knows who is involved and agrees with the decisions made in the relationship.  Those in the relationship are open with each other - being able to tell each other what they like and do not like in a relationship.  Respect is a cornerstone of the communication that allows openness.  This openness builds trust in the relationship.  Trust allows each member of the relationship to be comfortable being with and away from the other(s) in the relationship.  A vast majority of students prefer to be on their own or in a relationship with one other individual.  This may be the norm but that does not work for everyone.  Being in a HOT relationship avoids a great deal of conflict and mistrust. Unhealthy relationships are those of inequality and at times abuse such as when one person is controlling or believes that others should not be given the same freedoms they expect in the relationship.  People in these relationships feel untrustworthy and often find themselves feeling miserable.  There are more bad times than good in the relationship, and this is for any relationship, sexual or otherwise."
"social"|"Relationships and Sex"|"Sexual relationships are healthy, even if only one person is in the room.  For those who want more than one person in the room, one can seek out a partner/partners.  For any sexual relationship, you want enthusiastic partners.  Some people turn to dating websites.  With any website, make sure you understand what individuals are expecting from the website.  Tinder is known for sexual relationships that are more physical than emotional.  The opposite is true of eHarmony.  But that does not mean you cannot find both on whatever site you choose.  The best way to find out about websites is to talk with friends about it and get a recommendation or do some research online.  New sites pop up frequently - read the reviews carefully to determine if that website is for you."
"physical"|"What Shape Are You?"|"Being physical during your late teens and early twenties may seem like an additional use of time you just do not have but it is time well spent.  Those who are active when younger have a tendency to stay more active during the aging process.  For the most part, people who are active will have better blood pressure, breathing patterns, and less depression and anxiety, than if they did not exercise.  Exercising is one of the best ways to cope with stress - helping to reduce depression/anxiety.  We have a list of exercises that you may or may not have considered.  Some exercising is done indoors and other is outdoors so there is always something to do not matter what the weather is like. Examples: Aerobics, Ballet, Baseball, Basketball, Biking, Boating, Bowling, Boxing, Canoeing, Dance Dance Revolution, Dancing, Double Dutch, Field Hockey,Football,Frisbee,Golf,Gymnastics,Hiking,Hockey,Hopscotch,Horseback riding, Hula hooping, Ice Skating, Jogging, Juggling, Jump rope, Laser tag, Paintball, Ping-Pong, Playing catch, Rock Climbing, Roller Blading, Roller Skating, Running, Skateboarding, Skiing, Soccer, Softball, Swimming ,Tae Kwon Do, Tennis, Trampoline, Treadmill, Unicycling, Volleyball, Walking, Weightlifting, Wii sports games"
"physical"|"Get Physical"|"Campus has a number of ways to stay physically active, such as using the brand new Recreation Center.  We now have an indoor track on campus.  Challenge yourself and try to challenge a friend to go to the gym to exercise five times a week.  Does not have to be painful; you just have to move. RECentral is driven to provide you with at least one activity on a regular basis that gets you moving.  Check out their website, and under resources you can get their list of activities.  At the university, you will find people at every skill level exercising, because they know how important it is to move the body to enhance the mind.  Tai Chi is a form of exercise everyone or almost everyone can be involved into some degree, so take a risk, and find an exercise that suits you.  We have staff members taking luncheon walks around campus – join them or create one of your own and invite friends."
"physical"|"Intermurals"|"RECentral has a number of intramural activities throughout the year.  Many students miss the sports they used to play, but do not want to follow the rigors of training at college – join an intramural team.  If you like pickup games, this may be the place for you.  You can join a team and play throughout the 6 or 7 weeks.  You do not have to be the best, but you do have to be willing to put forth the effort to look into joining a team.  RECentral has the info and you have the desire.  "
"physical"|"Nutrition level up"|"At this point in your life you may be able to eat anything and not gain an ounce.  Oh, to be young, but aging does occur and your metabolism changes.  Try something different.  Try to level up on the nutrition scale - moving from one level to the next such as swapping out fried French fries and swapping in a fresh baked potato.  It is not quite the same, but it is close.  The more swapping up you do when you are younger, the more likely you will make healthy choices later in life.  There are some people in their sixties chasing the fast food franchises, while health continues to deteriorate.  Others in their seventies are still surfing the waves in Hawaii.  Now, there are many choices, but during the aging process, you begin to lose choices.  Think of the small changes you might be able to make habits this year.  Of course, you can have comfort foods on occasion and maintain a healthy weight."
"physical"|"Motivation to Move"|"Have you ever had the experience of needing to get out of bed, but your legs would not move?  You lay there telling yourself all the reasons to get up and then your inner voice starts shouting, Get up get up! and you get yourself out of that comfortable bed.  Go through a similar process to get yourself moving or find a dozen different ways to move that you had not thought about before, such as tai chi, fencing, swimming, dancing, hula hoop.  How you move is less important than moving.  Many people return to the activities in the physical section on exercise."
"intellectual"|"Research with professor/advisor"|"There are select majors that have more opportunities for research than others, but many professors have special projects that students can get involved in.  It is true that research and special projects are resume builders, but that is not the best reason to choose this avenue of connecting with the university.  These projects are a great look into the field and what you may want to have as part of your career.  Research lets you have a hands-on approach and learn while performing the research, improving your understanding of the concepts discussed in class.  If you get the chance to do research, see if you can make it an independent study, provide a poster at a conference, or get a chance to look at the final project, such as a chapter in a book.  The assistance you give to a professor is mentioned in the recommendation letter you need for that first professional job or graduate school application."
"intellectual"|"Independent Study"|"An independent study is a contract between a student and the university for anywhere from 1-6 credits.  The contract provides specifics as to the activities involved, the materials to be mastered, and the evaluation of the student’s work.  Independent studies usually involve specialized educational work by the student that is not covered by current classes.  If a student wants to study the effect of recent toxins from fire retardant on the fish life of a river, there may not be a course on it, thus the independent study.  Independent studies can be a bridge to graduate school, in that you can research a topic area covered by the university you plan on attending.  The grade is posted when the independent study is completed."
"intellectual"|"Communication with writers of research"|"An advantage of the internet is easy access to authors of papers.  Whether you attended a recent conference or want to research a topic area you read in a journal article, reaching out to the author is a great way of looking into the matter.  Most authors appreciate when another individual is seeking out information on a topic, they found interesting enough to research and write a paper on."
"intellectual"|"Raise Awareness"|"Advise administrators of an issue on campus and create plan of action. Students come from a variety of backgrounds and have a plethora of interests.  Use your energy to better your current institution.  You may find that your particular issue is shared by a number of students.  We have had students who want to share in keeping the neighborhood clean and created an annual clean-up crew that goes out more than once a year but holds that special date to raise awareness of living in a community.  Other students develop plans to make sure that services are available to students.  This group of students contacts various offices to determine availability of services.  Still other groups want to plant gardens throughout campus, developing hobbies for many students who join their effort.  These may become clubs or may just be a onetime only event.  Students do not have much time but do have energy, and that energy can be put to having a dozen students make the change each individual student is not able to make independently.  "
"intellectual"|"Life Goals"|"List your life goals near and far and review them each morning, remove barriers. Some see this as a bucket list, and in a way it can be.  While a bucket list is an action, a goal may be a thought, an action, or a feeling.  My goal may be to have a career with meaning.  If that is my goal, I have to review my values and make sure when making career choices to include my values.  I may want to help people.  In the short term, I can help people by working as a counselor on the Crisis Text Line, and then later in life continue that work while counseling at a local mental health clinic. Looking at life goals allows us to begin to plan and begin to see barriers.  To work on the Crisis Text Line, I need to follow through with training.  Well, if I do not have access to a computer, I will need to get access, possibly by borrowing a laptop from the university – that barrier is now gone.  Then, I move on to the next barrier."
"intellectual"|"Work the Homework"|"Identify times you are most productive for schoolwork and set aside for homework. Time management effects everyone but finding out when you are your most productive for a particular task is such a bonus.  Students are not equally productive with homework at all times of the day.  Do an experiment and study at various times of the day.  Think about how much you are comprehending, the least time spent rereading to identify the meaning of a sentence, and when you were least distracted by what is going on inside (hungry, fatigued from a meal, etc) as well as outside (noise, people talking, looking out the window, etc.) Identify the times you are best at studying for exams, doing reading, writing papers, or any other activity associated with school.  Then, set aside that time for studying.  I know, this is a no-brainer, but keeping that time just for studying is the hard part. That time needs to be held sacred. "
"intellectual"|"Study Groups sponsored by Departments"|"Get involved in study groups whenever you have a great deal of information to master in a short period of time. You have a variety of classes and each one can be quite demanding, but usually one sticks out as having too much material to cover.  See if you can get into a study group.  The study group covers a number of different aspects of intellectual wellness from the sharing of ideas, solidifying understanding of ideas, communication through the summaries shared, and the ability to master the massive amount of material."
"intellectual"|"How to cope with a bad grade"|"Bad grades happen to almost everyone.  One bad grade typically does not change a life a great deal.  It does not normally stop us from attending graduate school or keep us from that perfect job.  It can make us challenge us to use our resources to identify a way of handling retaking the class, taking the class at another school, or taking the loss and moving on to another class.  If I take the class over, the new grade swaps out for the old.  Maybe I want to investigate taking that class with a different professor.  Some majors have a gatekeeper course, one taught by only one professor so everyone in that major must take the gatekeeper.  If this is the case, rely on peers in your major to figure out the best way to work on this class.  Before I take the same professor again, I want to minimize my stressors, take other classes that will leave extra time for the class I am retaking, and use the Learning Center or a tutor to make sure I pass the class.  If taking that class at an alternate school, check with the Registrar’s office to make certain the class credits will transfer."
"financial"|"Part-time job on/off campus"|"Many students in need of money will seek part-time employment.  For some students, losing 10 hours a week to a job helps them to become more organized, but for others the job is an additional burden that can create conflicts with academic work.  Several things to consider when looking at the cost-benefit of a part-time job…1. Do I really need the money?  Review your budget (see beat the budget blues), write everything down for how much money I have for the semester.  Then subtract everything that is essential from that budget such as books, food, rent, gas, car repairs, etc.  Then decide if what is leftover will be enough to get through the remainder of the semester, if not, the job may work best.  2. If you decide to get a job, consider “on” versus “off” campus.  On-campus work understands you are a student and may need some variability in your schedule during midterms and finals.  Make sure to let your boss know as soon as you are aware of the need to change a schedule.  Certain jobs cannot make accommodations and you may be disappointed.  For off-campus jobs it is a different world, and you can put your academic work behind you just focus on the job.  Unfortunately, the off-campus jobs typically are not concerned about your academic work.  If you put in to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the job will not care if your professor assigns you a play to review that is during your shifts."
"financial"|"Career Success"|"Career Success Center can help in a number of ways.  They bring in outside vendors (places to work) on a regular basis not only for seniors for full-time work, but also for part-time and seasonal work.  Many times, the individuals providing information at the table can sign up a student for an interview.  They also know about who is looking for additional help at the university.  They have contacts for part-time work on campus – make sure you know if you have work study.  Many more departments can hire students with work-study because the funds do not come out of their departmental budget. A. Resume – Career services can help you create and/or fine-tune your resume, so your information is easily available to anyone reading it.  They advise on placement of information and in what manner, so your resume stands out to future employers.  Many times, students will return to update their resume, adding in a recent research project or paper presentation. B. Interview Skills – No matter how many times you interview there are always times you wished you had said something different.  The Career Success Center will review your strengths and weaknesses in an interview process.  They will also help you choose words wisely, such as how to express a weakness so others can tell how you manage stressful situations.  Such as I hate people yelling at me, so one time when I had a particularly loud customer, I said, “I understand you are upset, but I can hear you much better if your voice wasn’t quite so loud.” C. Career Success Center can help you look at various careers in your major.  The first stop, though, is with your professors, especially your advisor.  The advisor should be able to list a number of careers in that particular field.  These jobs may or may not be open on a part-time basis, but if so, would be helpful for a resume especially when looking at internships."
"financial"|"Beat the Budget Blues"|"A budget consists of earnings and expenditures.  The difficulty resides in the earnings outweighing the expenditures.  Most young adults have never had a checkbook, so how much they have is based on the what’s left over effect – is there anything left in my account?  This works when the rent and utilities are already paid, but now may be a good time to start practicing a budget.  As you can see by the sheet below, a budget includes a number of expenditures, some are necessities and others are optional.  Always start with necessities.  If I put candy before the movie tickets, I may not have enough for the movie.  A. On campus, the room and utilities are paid in advance, but figure out how much it is costing you (or someone else) each month – you live there for roughly 4 months a semester.  When you get an apartment, you will have to pay rent and utilities every month (rent remains the same while utilities vary).  Most people balance utilities with food, so during winter months they cut back on going out to eat since the weather is bad anyway.  B. Food varies greatly depending on whether someone dines at restaurants for most of their meals, gets take-out a half dozen times a week, or prefers to stay home and cook.  How much you make will definitely impact this category.  A number of people will ask for a take-out box when their meal arrives so they can split the meal in two, saving another portion for later in the week.  Also, find places where you can get a meal such as at a soup kitchen, or from Maria’s place here on campus – each student can take up to 10 items a visit for free to help them get through to the next paycheck.  C. Transportation is a necessity, but a car may not be.  Every student can get a bus pass each semester to get around Connecticut.  Students who do not drive are able to get almost anywhere in the state between buses, trains, and an Uber once in a while.  If you have a car, you need to budget for gas and repairs.  Everyone who has a car budgets for gas, but we rarely budget for repairs and get stuck when the car breaks down.  Accountants will tell you to budget for about 50 cents a mile for gas and repairs – that is a ballpark figure.  "
"spiritual"|"Volunteer at Agency on/off Campus"|"Volunteer work can be extremely rewarding.  There have been students who start volunteering and then make that their lifes work.  Creating their own start up non-profit and letting it build from there.  Choosing volunteer work may take a little time.  For certain work, such as in a hospital, one will be asked to volunteer a certain number of hours - the contract specifying the training involved and the need for consistency.  Other work, one can drop in when there are a few extra hours in the week.  I know you do not experience having this extra time, but after two exams and a paper, nothing can be better than sorting through cans at the food bank to clear your mind of stressful events."
"spiritual"|"Spend Time with Friends"|"Friends can help us maintain our spiritual and emotional wellbeing.  When with friends find a time everyone can meet each week and dedicate yourselves to having that time to socialize.  Does not matter the activity, as long as everyone gets a chance to talk about life, school, work, relationships, and anything else in a student's life. Starting conversation about coping with school, and everything else can bring new ways of dealing with barriers in our way.  Sometimes another person will have a resource, or a way of solving a problem we had not thought about."
"spiritual"|"Giving Back"|"Giving back in your own way – feeding birds, working with animals, working with people, volunteering to sort materials for a friend who is moving.  Does not matter what we do, just giving back in our own way makes us feel good.  There are people who will seek out opportunities to help without doing anything formal.  A neighbor may be moving, and you help them move materials from a truck into the house.  Another friend has volunteered to make a Thanksgiving dinner for a shelter, and you bake for the party without going to the shelter."
"spiritual"|"Values ranking excercise"|""Many people need to clarify their values so they can get a best match with their volunteer work.  We learn our values from our parents and friends and then hone them through our relationships.  If you could look at the attached exercise, you can begin the process of exploring values, especially those most important to you."
"spiritual"|"Role of a Mentor"|"Identifying who can help you focus on your values. Many times, people choose a mentor based on their intellectual capacity, which is reasonable but doesn’t always work out.  Not only intellectual capacity, but also the person’s personal values may make for a better match.  If I am in business and would like to be successful, my mentor may steer me in the direction of using only par-time employment to save on benefits – may make the business more profitable, but I may be looking to work with the same staff for a number of years which is less likely to happen with part-time staff.  Mentors usually sign on for many more years than those covered by the mentorship.  People who take on the role of mentor, often expect the mentee to ask questions as their careers’ start."
"spiritual"|"Positives in giving back"|""For people who benefit from doing volunteer work or anything in which there is not a direct benefit of goods or services to the person, they do get something back.  People get a very positive feeling from helping others, being able to provide assistance without expectation.  We feel like we have been able to help another person who would otherwise struggle more if we did not provide the assistance at that moment in time.  Whether it is helping with dropped groceries, or providing a meal to a homeless person, there is a sense of helping or fellow person, and it gives a good feeling.  On our campus, we have Sandwich Heroes in which a group of people will provide over 200 sandwiches to the shelters in Hartford.  How long does it take? About 90 minutes depending on the group making the sandwiches.  Most of us can spend 90 minutes helping others.  Being an active bystander, like from the training Bringing in the Bystander, can give a person a very good feeling with costing only a few moments of time."
"spiritual"|"Connect with Nature"|"Get outside and connect with nature in some way.  I am not talking about climbing Mount Washington, although you could, I am talking about going for a walk, a hike, a bike ride, a stroll, through a park, by a lake (not through it unless in a canoe), up a hillside.  New Britain has some phenomenal rose gardens, the Stanley Quarter park, and some nice rides around lakes.  Be out in the fresh air and let yourself relax.  Spend an afternoon watching the wildlife in the park – maybe feed some birds.  We are all part of the greater life that surrounds us."
"emotional"|"To-Do or Not To-Do"|"To-Do list of 5-6 items only and schedule out homework at the same times each day to make it a habit – To Do lists are designed to make your life easier and make you more successful.  The lists contain the most important work for that given day and generally take no more than a few moments to create.  People who lay awake at night and think of the things to be done the next day can generate the list and get to bed knowing it has been noted.  Now, the length of the list, 5-6 items only, has been chosen because it is doable; people can feel good that they were able to complete so many things in a day and not feel like they have only done half the list.  We need that positive sense of accomplishment.  Now, everybody can put simple things on the list such as put on my shoes and tie my shoes, but that would be the opposite of putting down fly to Nepal and climb to base camp.  The items on the list need to be mostly doable within a day.  For larger projects, break it down to smaller components, as in writing a term paper.  If you create these lists and want to track your progress, then save them over time and you will find out what times of day you are most productive for which tasks.  Speaking of that, doing homework about the same time each day allows you to get the work done, or at least make sure you have time to do the work.  The only encouragement would be not to multitask.  If I am doing homework, while my roommate is socializing, my train of thought will focus on words of the conversation instead of my homework."
"emotional"|"Stress Less"|"Maintain daily awareness of your stress level and reduce activity when stress is high.  Each day, I can give my stress level a number between 1 and 10.  One is least stressed – so relaxed and 10 is most stressed – melt down time.  The reason for giving each day a number is to monitor your stress throughout the week.  No brainer – less stressed on the weekend and most stressed during the week, not necessarily.  There are weekends during midterms when studying and socializing do not mix.  Or, you get to spend the weekend at a significant others house and get to be stressed by others there.  To be truthful, relationships cause more stress than most other things, because they are more unpredictable than other things.  Allow yourself the time to be aware of the things in your world causing you stress and consider ways of making changes to improve your level of stress.  If you are feeling too stressed too much of the time, come in and see a Counselor, so that the situation doesn’t get worse"
"emotional"|"Breate In, Breathe Out"|"Take 10 minutes a day to deep breath and imagine a calming place.  Seriously, the benefits to this can be enormous.  The breathing needs to be from your diaphragm; your stomach has to move.  Most people will breathe to a count, such as breathe into a count of 7, hold for a count of 2, and then breathe out to a count of 7.  While breathing in this manner, close your eyes and imagine a beautiful, peaceful place in your world or from your past.  Allow yourself to consider the sights, smells, sounds, and touch of this place while breathing and relaxing.  Offer yourself a chance, if possible, to be there again once you have completed your academic work.  In relaxing in this manner three times a day, it allows you an opportunity to decrease your level of stress creating a buffer when new stressors come from the day.  When you get good at relaxing, try to listen to music while relaxing.  Those successful with adding music will be able to play the music and their bodies will automatically start to relax due to muscle memory.  Imagine, being in a traffic jam, listening to a song, and relaxing.  It is possible."
"emotional"|"Reward Yourself"|"Give yourself an activity, such as spending a day in Boston as a reward for getting through the semester.  Plan out a day trip – does not matter the location, except Mars, do not plan for Mars – something doable. You may have to save a little money, but the bus system can get you quite far in Connecticut.  Then, during each week, take time to relax and plan out something else to do on the trip.  You may be going to downtown Hartford, but look into the travel to and from, the places to eat, what you will be able to see when you get there, etc.  many times, there are so many interesting things to do you have to pick and choose.  If you cannot go far, but what to know what you can do – ask someone from that city.  You may be impressed with the activities. If you really cannot afford anything, then pick a trip to plan for when you graduate.  Think about spending some time of that summer working and then going on a trip at the end of the summer or early in the fall.  You may get a job before graduation, then tell them at interview about the trip you had planned for September, so you still get to take the trip."
"emotional"|"Check Off that Work"|"Keep an eye on your classroom requirements and check them off as you complete them.  Nothing keeps us more emotionally well than being able to stay on top of our work.  For students, that work is coming from 3-5 different sources who do not talk with each other about homework.  As you check off the assignments, you complete 3 tasks: 1 seeing what you have done, 2 seeing what you have to do, and 3 planning out your time.  If you do not understand an assignment or need more time, seek out your professor during office hours or before/after class.  If you really want to take that extra step, you can figure out how many total points you have towards your grade by looking at the grade on the assignment and multiplying it by the value of that assignment.  Let us say a paper is worth 20 percent of my grade and I get an 80 on the paper – then I multiply 80X0.2 and get 16 points towards my final grade.  Sometimes doing this can make a student nervous, but better to know."
"emotional"|"No Complaint Roomates"|"Creating a healthy roommate environment – Mark Twain once commented that guests are like fish, they are only good for 3 days.  You will not get along with everyone you will be living with throughout your lifetime.  To create a healthy roommate environment, first focus on compromise.  Everyone in the room needs to be able to compromise for everyone to get along.  The first step is to sit down and find out what lifestyle everyone would like to have in the room.  Then start working on moving toward that environment.  Sometimes, there will eb an issue in which compromise is limited, such as temperature of the room.  Then one may have to rely on majority and the person may decide to move along.  However, if compromise can be reached then the rules get created including consequences for when rules are broken.  Individuals need to have a sense of order, so everyone has the same understanding.  As an example, dirty dishes – how long should they stay in the sink?  For some hours, other days…who do you think will be doing most of the dishes if left up to chance?  If you are unable to compromise, then choose to live alone – costs will be higher, but you will get the chance to create a healthy room for yourself, or as healthy as possible."
"environmental"|"Study Nook"|"Find a quiet place on campus to study.  Unless you can block out noise, find a quiet place to study, such as in the library, the fourth floor of Vance academic building, a back corner section of Willard Diloreto near the card office, inside the Wellness section of Student Wellness Center.  Try to get back to the place as often as you can so you can determine when the quiet moments are available.  Too many people try to study in a noisy area and get distracted.  Their homework takes longer and is not as good as when they can maintain focus on the homework alone.  Try doing homework when you are hungry, while people around you eat foods you like to eat.  You really cannot help but look up from time to time wishing you were having a meal."
"environmental"|"Sleep Well"|"Make sure you have a place that is comfortable for sleeping.  One of the biggest complaints from students is the lack of time to sleep.  Now, add on the fact that the room is too warm, or the roommate snores, or roommates come in when you are trying to sleep, or it’s not your room – the one you left behind.  Eventually, you will be able to find a way to compensate to the best of your exhausted ability, but sleep will not be as good.  Sleep is such an important commodity – in general people sleep better in a slightly cooler room.  They vary on noise level, but bright lights almost always interfere with the sleep/wake cycle.  Sleeping in on the weekend does not catch you up, especially on REM sleep.  You are better off figuring out a way to compromise on the interruptions to sleep.  Some individuals cannot get along when it comes to sleep.  Sleep deprivation interferes with the memory/concentration, mood, ability to process information, ability to fight off infections and overall sense of wellbeing."
"environmental"|"Socializing at Meals"|"Meals should be with peers whenever possible – we are social beings, so spending time with peers while eating allows us to accomplish two tasks at once.  We have the opportunity to find out what is happening in people’s lives as well as talk about the difficulties with classes, or work or whatever.  As we eat, we need to keep aware of emotional eating.  If our friends are emotional eaters, we may want to wait to get food until after they have finished their first round of lunch.  Meals should be slow and relaxed – allowing us time to begin to feel full – takes about 20 minutes.  Many times, people will decide on what they want to eat as they go through the lunch line.  Do not, take a step back and figure out what you would like to eat – then get the food."
"environmental"|"Discovering the Neighborhood"|"Take time to get to know your surroundings.  I am not saying look left and right in each class to see who sits next to you, that should be an automatic along with a greeting.  Get to know the campus and the shops and restaurants that surround the campus.  The reason is you may want to have lunch at a local establishment for a change of pace.  Or, your roommate may need something, and you can point them in the right direction.  The longer you stay anywhere, the more you should get to know your surroundings.  New Britain has an art museum, an industry museum, a large toy store, a soda factory, and much more.  These things will not come to you, you get to seek them out.  Last semester, businesses gave students a break in visiting downtown New Britain, something to check on every semester.  The buses can get you to shopping centers and more – you can get a free bus pass at the Card office.  The more you know about the surrounding area, the more interesting you will become to other students."
"environmental"|"Be the One"|"Practice what you preach. Follow through on ways to change your world. It does not have to be big, just has to be for you.  You do not have to pick up all the trash in New Britain, but you can pick up around a particular building.  You do not have to walk every dog at the shelter, but the three you do walk twice a week will appreciate it.  The little things add up if everyone is doing the little things.  Start with your own words.  What do you complain about and in what way can you make a difference?  If you believe it is important enough, share the idea with the student government.  Who knows, you may not start a trend, you may start a movement.  Many years ago, a student wanted to clean up around the campus. That student was joined by another 40 students and now we have a day dedicated to helping to clean up New Britain."
"environmental"|"No Goal in Life"|"No Goal in Life How to deal with not having goals: When an individual has no goals in life and finds themselves wandering, one of the best things they can do is find others who have goals and ask them how they came to those goals, try to pick someone who is at the same developmental stage in life.  Another tasks that may help is to begin to identify your last goal and how you came to have that as a goal.  Many times, young adults find that goals gave almost been proscribed for them.  You go to High School and then on to college, that is just what you do.  If that is the case, then begin to think about what you would like your future to look like in 5 years – I want a mansion and a yacht.  That is possible; however, not as probable as a nice 2-bedroom apartment and a canoe.  Whatever the goal, write it down and then write down the steps to obtaining the goal.  The steps may include passing certain difficult courses, cutting back on expenses so you can save the money for a canoe, or starting to price 2-bedroom apartments near where you would like to work.  Another avenue is to seek counseling whether it be career counseling, personal counseling, or financial counseling to move you closer to identifying goals.  Once you have the goal, steps to obtaining the goal, then track your progress and make necessary adjustments."
"occupational"|"Clubs and Intermurals"|"Seek out something new.  We have so many clubs and intramurals every semester or every year try something new.  You do not have to stick with it, you just need to try it.  Do you like broccoli, whether yes or no, you still had to try it.  Seek out the sport or the club activity and try it out.  Sometimes, people find what they like to do the club activities more than their own major and then change majors that are similar to the club.  If you cannot find a club on campus, feel free to create a club.  All you need do is put up flyers and get several students interested.  Then create an executive committee and petition student life to create the club."
"occupational"|"Arts & Crafts"|"Arts & crafts club and Wellness Education community hours involve arts and crafts while socializing.  Sometimes when we are worried about being in a social situation, it is best to have an activity to occupy our hands while we think about what to say.  You can try out making a craft while talking with your peers.  The craft may be something you have not done in a while but are now getting back to as a way of relaxing, so it can be coloring, bead work, paint by number, whatever it may be.  The people around you can be discussing anything, and you can listen or speak up and add to the conversation.  One of the nice things is if you can find commonality with others.  There have been times when the others turned to one person and found she/he had an expertise in what they were talking about, so they learned more about the subject."
"occupational"|"Recommend and Activity"|"Suggest a weekend activity through CAN/SGA. Go to the next meeting of CAN or SGA and suggest your activity.  We are always looking for things to do on the weekend, so why not your thing?  On campus they have held mud volleyball matches and someone had to suggest it.  Think about the places you have been, and the activities held at those places.  If you think it would be a good fit with our campus, such as a karate tournament, suggest it.  We even tried to break a Guinness World Record on this campus – did not make the record but had an interesting time trying."
"occupational"|"Classes beyond the books"|"Take a photography/art class to see if you like it or just like learning about it.  Most students have given up art classes thinking they were “no good at it”, but you are a different person now.  Try a class again in one of the arts.  People have found they like it so much they get a side business going.  I encourage people to create what they like even if they do not think it is good, because then they can display it in their room or their apartment.  Sometimes we do not know how good we are at something.  I know someone who believes everyone can build a computer.  I bet there are a number of computer people who agree.  I do not have that talent, but he does.  Give art/photography/dance a chance to express yourself.  If you decide you do not like it, keep at least one memento to remind yourself of your courage to at least try."
"occupational"|"Review Writing"|"Spend time with friends writing reviews: sports, restaurants, movies, presentations.  This is a great way to spend your time and it really helps the people around you.  You and your friends can review local dinners and help students find the spot that is worth the money.  We have all had the experience of seeing a movie that we could have waited until HBO had the film, but we didn’t know.  With your review in hand the person could make a more informed and better choice.  Sports reviews are all over the YouTube market.  Get the practice in now and hone the skills that will get you 100,000 views. Write the reviews and share them with friends and family and get the feedback.  Help others to avoid wasting their time."
"occupational"|"Exploring likes and dislikes"|"Make a journal that includes your likes and dislikes.  Then when you go out shopping or out to eat, review the journal ahead of time. While out, choose differently.  Choose a different type of shirt/blouse or try a different type of food.  Too many of us get boxed in – going out to eat burgers, pizza, tacos or Chinese.  Mix it up a little or a lot and explore.  If you are not that adventurous, ask at your local place if there is something not on the menu that the establishment makes and try that.  Then write about it in your journal."
